### Droppp.io

**URLs**: https://droppp.io

**Updates**: 

- On Mar 26, 2025 we launched [Droppp Arcade](https://droppp.io/arcade/), a competitive leaderboard system with prizes for the top 333. After only four days of being live over a million Funko NFTs have been burned for points.   

Stats: - Droppp has created over 206k WAX “*.dp” accounts (verifiable on chain), and we only do this for users who either pay (USD) for an account or for a pack during a drop, so we believe that most if not all are real accounts (vs bots).
