### <ins>April 2025 Update</ins>
We are pleased to provide an update on the latest developments and contributions from **One In A Cillian** to the WAX blockchain ecosystem. With the upcoming changes to the **requirements for guilds**, we are closely following updates and adapting to ensure we continue adding value to the chain.  

### <ins>Noteworthy</ins>
Since our last update we have enhanced our **Hyperion solution** by introducing a **proxy deployment component** within Docker, streamlining reverse proxy integration and optimising resource allocation.

We remain committed to maintaining high reliability and performance standards within the WAX network.

### <ins> IPFS Deployment Offering</ins>
Since the last update, we have developed and deployed a new IPFS hosting solution with enhanced features. This deployment integrates Prometheus and Grafana for advanced monitoring and performance tracking, including pre-configured dashboards for seamless adoption. The solution is designed to simplify the management and scalability of IPFS services while maintaining flexibility through Docker Compose-based deployment.

Update on IPFS Deploy
We are pleased to announce enhancements to our IPFS Deploy offering, with the addition of image and video resizing capabilities. These new features have been seamlessly integrated into the original codebase, allowing users to efficiently resize images and videos directly within the deployment environment.

This functionality enhances the versatility of our IPFS services, catering to a broader range of use cases, particularly for applications requiring optimised multimedia handling.

As always, the updated codebase is available for review, and we welcome feedback from the community to further improve this offering.
We have now switched our own IPFS deployment to https://github.com/oneinacillian/ipfs-deploy and successfully test the resizing of content through our IPFS hosted gateway on WAX: https://ipfs-gateway.oiac.io and will continue to monitor the stability.

IPFS Enhancements (February 2025)

We have implemented several key improvements to enhance the reliability, performance, and scalability of our IPFS infrastructure:

- **Content Availability Monitoring** – Added a replication endpoint to track content availability across the network.  
- **Content Distribution & Redundancy** – Introduced a dedicated content distribution endpoint to improve replication and ensure redundancy across the IPFS network.  
- **Protocol Upgrades** – Upgraded to Kubo v0.27.0, enhancing the routing system for better content discovery and distribution.  
- **Performance Optimisations** – Updated to Node.js 20.x LTS, delivering significant performance gains and improved memory management.  
- **Reproducible Builds** – Locked NPM dependencies to maintain consistency across different environments.  
- **Provider Discovery Improvements** – Enhanced provider discovery mechanisms for more reliable content replication and tracking.  
- **System Maintenance & Troubleshooting** – Improved logging and error handling to streamline system monitoring and issue resolution.  

These upgrades reinforce our commitment to maintaining a robust and efficient infrastructure for the WAX ecosystem.


### <ins>New Service Offering: Hyperion Full Snapshots</ins>
We are now hosting Hyperion full snapshots via the following domain:
https://hyperionmainsnaps.oiac.io/

 * Purpose: These full snapshots assist developers and block producers by providing rapid synchronisation and a reliable backup of Hyperion data.
 * Frequency: Hosted and updated regularly to ensure timely availability for users.
This service reflects our continued commitment to offering high-quality infrastructure support for the WAX blockchain.

### <ins>New Service Offering: Validator Checker Utility</ins>
At Oneinacillian, we understand the importance of tracking validator portals for downtime and missed events. While most guilds monitor their own services, keeping a frequent eye on the health of key portals is crucial.

To support the WAX ecosystem, we are excited to introduce our new Validator Checker Utility. This tool monitors the Sengine, LedgerWise, and ValidationCore portals, detecting any changes or potential disruptions and reporting them through Prometheus via a Prometheus gateway.

 * Repository: [Validator Checker Utility](https://github.com/oneinacillian/validatorchecker)
 * Documentation: Follow the README for setup instructions.
We intend to share this utility with other guilds imminently, as we believe it will enhance the monitoring and reliability of the WAX blockchain network. As this is the first release, we will ensure it stays up to date with any changes to the monitored portals and welcome feedback to improve the tool further.

### <ins>Docker Project</ins>

https://github.com/oneinacillian/docker_compose_autobuilds  

**Update**: 

April 2025 update - We have extended the **Hyperion solution** by introducing a **proxy deployment component**, which is automatically generated by a Python utility. This prepares the environment based on the `.env` configuration settings.  

### Key Enhancements:  
- **Integrated Reverse Proxy** – The requirement for an external reverse proxy is now embedded within the Docker stack.  
- **Flexible Deployment** – Allows running a reverse proxy inside the Docker solution, even on hosts that already have a reverse proxy, via **custom port binding (configurable in `.env`)**.  
- **Resource Optimisation** – The component includes configurable resource allocation to **limit usage and prevent contention**.  

### Next Steps:  
We plan to **integrate a Certbot component** to automatically generate and rotate SSL certificates based on the **production aliases specified in `.env`**.  

https://github.com/oneinacillian/docker_compose_autobuilds/blob/main/README.md

March 2025 update - Improvements have been made to our Docker Compose auto-builds to enhance deployment efficiency and configurability based on specific environment needs. Key changes include:  

- **Added configurable memory and CPU limits** for each service, managed via environment variables (e.g., `REDIS_MEMORY=2g`, `REDIS_CPUS=1`).  
- **Applies to**: Redis, RabbitMQ, Hyperion, Node, Kibana, Prometheus, and Grafana.  
- **Helps prevent resource contention and ensures stable performance.**  
- **Introduced the `MONITORING_ENABLED` environment variable**:  
  - When disabled, removes Prometheus, Grafana, and all exporters (Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, Nodeos).  
  - Useful for development environments or resource-constrained systems, reducing overhead when monitoring isn't needed.  

These changes improve system stability, efficiency, and flexibility across different deployment environments.  

We have made several updates and enhancements to the Auto-Build solution, improving its functionality, monitoring capabilities, and ease of use. Below is a summary of the changes:

## 1. Improved Navigation and Documentation
- Updated the README for easier navigation, including detailed descriptions of changes and implementations.

## 2. Nodeos Monitoring
- Built a custom exporter for chain data (nodeos).
- Created a managed dashboard to monitor chain information.

## 3. Hyperion Monitoring
- Added exporters for RabbitMQ, Redis, and Elasticsearch.
- Integrated Prometheus and Grafana services into the compose process during Python script execution.
- Developed managed dashboards for Redis, RabbitMQ, and Elasticsearch.

## 4. Atomic Monitoring
- Added exporters for PostgreSQL and Redis.
- Developed managed dashboards for PostgreSQL and Redis.

## 5. Elasticsearch Management
- Expanded the Python script to dynamically manage Elasticsearch exporter configurations in Prometheus.
- Extended `.env` to manage Elasticsearch heap dump and GC log parameters.
- Introduced health checks for Elasticsearch instances.
- Automated Elasticsearch configuration management.

These enhancements aim to provide a more robust and user-friendly Auto-Build solution, supporting efficient deployment, monitoring, and management of services.
