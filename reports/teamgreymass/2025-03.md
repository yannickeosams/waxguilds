## Does your Guild have any new information to submit that impacts Product Development?

Our team so far in 2025 has placed a huge focus on Unicove, to serve as an open-source web wallet and block explorer interface. Our initial launch in late 2024 was focused on EOS, so we weren't reporting this (or much at all). As of a couple weeks ago, we managed to get parallel builds running for chain-specific deployments, which now also includes WAX and the WAX Testnet.

We have updated our mobile versions of Anchor to now point to wax.unicove.com as the default "Web Wallet". While we are still missing some WAX specific functionality, the majority of the account management, the block explorer, and the smart contract tooling should all be compatible.
