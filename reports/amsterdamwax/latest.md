### Light API (development & hosting)

**URLs**: [https://github.com/cc32d9/eosio_light_api](https://github.com/cc32d9/eosio_light_api)

**Description**: The API is providing information about WAX blockchain accounts and token balances. Also an endpoints for a number of testnets are available. We developed this API and are currently hosting with a robust infrastructure that has redundancy built into it, making our endpoint the choice for major players in the WAX ecosystem such as Alcor, Wombat, waxblock.io, EOS Authority, Dawn of Victory, and many more.

### Chronicle

**URLs**: [https://github.com/EOSChronicleProject/eos-chronicle/releases](https://github.com/EOSChronicleProject/eos-chronicle/releases)

**Description**: Chronicle is a software component designed to process the history of an Antelope (formely EOSIO) blockchain. Chronicle release 3.3 is available now on Github. It fixes a floating point overflow bug that broke LightAPI on WAX. EOS Amsterdam has contributed to the software development costs.

**Update**: 
None in the reporting period.

### Chronos

**URLs**: [https://github.com/EOSChronicleProject/chronos](https://github.com/EOSChronicleProject/chronos)

**Description**: Chronos is a history solution for Antelope blockchains. Chronos indexes the transaction traces of an Antelope blockchain in a ScyllaDB database. ScyllaDB is an open-source re-implementation of Apache Cassandra database. It's faster because it's implemented in C++, and it supports data sharding.

The database architecture allows for an enormous data ingestion performance. A single server can handle about 100k inserts per second with secondary indexes and materialized views, or even 500k inserts per second without secondary indexes.

### Memento

**URLs**: [https://github.com/Antelope-Memento/antelope_memento](https://github.com/Antelope-Memento/antelope_memento)

**Description**: Memento is a MariaDB or Postgresql/TimescaleDB database containing transaction traces from an EOSIO blockchain (such as EOS, Telos or WAX), and providing convenient indexes for quick searching.

A typical use case for Memento is tracking incoming and outgoing payments for a specific account, and checking their reversibility. The database may contain traces for all contracts on the blockchain, or it may be limited to a specific subset of accounts. dApps can set up their own instances, while public infrastructure providers may offer the service to a wider audience.
